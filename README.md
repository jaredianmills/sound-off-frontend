# sound-off-frontend

This is the frontend repo for a game I made at Flatiron School as part of the JavaScript course with two other students:
  - Claudia Maniscalchi (https://github.com/cmaniscalchi)
  - Jack Yeung (https://github.com/jyeung-se)

  Here is a link to the backedend repo: https://github.com/jaredianmills/sound-off-backend
